Data Preprocessing Strategy for Handling Missing Values in the Producer
Objective:
The primary goal is to handle missing values in the dataset represented by -200. These missing values need to be managed before sending the data to the Kafka producer. In this context, the dataset represents air quality readings, and -200 marks missing or unavailable sensor readings.

Preprocessing Strategy:
Identify Missing Values: In the dataset, the -200 values indicate missing sensor data. These need to be replaced with NaN (Not a Number) for further processing.

Imputation or Removal:

Impute Missing Values: Since -200 represents a placeholder for missing data, a common approach is to replace these values with a valid imputation method. In this case, we can use the column mean to impute missing values.

Alternative: If you choose to filter out rows with missing data (if data imputation is not preferred), you could simply remove the rows where the value is NaN. However, for this example, we will proceed with imputation.

Imputation Method:

Column Mean Imputation: Replace the missing NaN values with the mean value of each column (sensor reading). This ensures that no information is lost, and the data remains useful for downstream processing and modeling.

Justification for the Chosen Approach:
Imputation vs. Removal: Imputing missing values ensures that we do not lose valuable data by removing rows, especially when sensor data is typically sparse. By using the column mean, we maintain the overall distribution of data without introducing significant bias.

Column Mean Imputation: Using the mean of the column is a simple and effective method for imputation in many cases, especially when the data is reasonably stable (as in the case of continuous sensor readings). It ensures that the imputed values do not disrupt the overall data trends.
